I'm not really sure what to write about here. Don't usually make blog posts so this will be interesting.

I followed the [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/) tutorial to create this basic blog website.

I also decided to augment the tutorial by adding TypeScript on top.

This was my first experience with both Next.js and TypeScript and so far it has been a success. There are still some syntactical nuances of JavaScript that don't totally make sense to me as a primarily .NET developer, but I am getting the hang of things.
